## üìã Task Details

### Current Focus: Server Refactoring

**Objective**: Replace FastMCP with official MCP Python SDK

**Key Changes Needed**:
1. Import official MCP Server class
2. Replace FastMCP decorators with official MCP handlers
3. Implement proper initialization and capabilities
4. Convert tool functions to MCP protocol format
5. Use stdio_server transport

**Files to Modify**:
- `postgres_mcp_server.py` (major refactoring)

**Expected Impact**:
- Full MCP protocol compliance
- Compatible with any MCP client
- Future-proof against protocol changes

## üìù Notes

### Architecture Decisions
- **Using Official MCP SDK**: Ensures protocol compliance and future compatibility
- **Azure First Approach**: Designed specifically for Azure Database for PostgreSQL
- **READ-ONLY Design**: Security by design, only SELECT operations allowed
- **Connection Pooling**: Optimized for both local and remote database performance

### Configuration Strategy
- **Environment-based Profiles**: Easy switching between local/dev/prod
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing .env configurations will continue to work
- **Azure-Optimized**: SSL enforcement, proper authentication, connection tuning
